**Hi, I'm Felix Dreissig.**

I consider myself a Computer Scientist at the intersection of software development, IT operations, and information security.

I currently work at [codecentric](https://www.codecentric.de/), where I contribute technical expertise to the company's Information Security Management. Previously, I worked at [noris network](https://www.noris.de/) as IT Security Engineer in an ops/SRE team delivering core services to the company.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from [FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.fau.eu/) with a focus on information security, distributed and operating systems, and compiler technology. In a side job during my studies, I used to do Python programming and work on streaming data processing with Apache Flink. I also have experience in full-stack web development, Linux infrastructure automation, and computer networking.

Besides that, I used to compete in (IT security) CTFs with [our local team](https://faust.cs.fau.de) and am still responsible for infrastructure development and hosting at our own [FAUST CTF](https://www.faustctf.net).
