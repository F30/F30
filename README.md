**Hi, I'm Felix Dreissig.**

I consider myself a Computer Scientist at the intersection of software development, IT operations, and information security.

I currently work at [noris network](https://www.noris.de/) as IT Security Engineer in an ops/SRE team delivering core services to the company. Before that, I studied Computer Science at [FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.fau.eu/) with a focus on IT security, distributed and operating systems, and compiler technology.

In a side job during my studies, I used to do Python programming and work on streaming data processing using Apache Flink. I also have some experience in full-stack web development, Linux infrastructure automation, and computer networking.

Besides that, I (used to?) play (IT security) CTFs with [our local team](https://faust.cs.fau.de) and am involved in the infrastructure development and hosting for our own [FAUST CTF](https://www.faustctf.net).
